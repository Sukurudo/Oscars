Based on the real-life events of Yorkshire coal miners and secret gay lovers, Tommy and Eddy, who spend their annual week holiday at a quirky B & B in Blackpool, along with a few other alternative members of society – the transgender Mr. Elbridge, the ex-show girl Red Ethel and the eccentric owner Gladys and her flirty daughter Maureen. The film takes us on a rollercoaster journey through the North of England to the beaches of Greece, as we follow each character’s fight for equality and freedom in an age that still deemed being gay, or “different” as a crime.  Our protagonists find courage in one another's bravery and initiate the first walks towards gay pride in the UK as they walk the length of Blackpool pier, defying prejudice and abuse.",/p2TUvuVP1i7mh8ygXYs0EnIndXZ.jpg,0.6,tt10039338,,,,,,

The family-heavy cast doesn’t soften what is a dark but exceedingly tender look at childhood in a broken home.  The story revolves around the two siblings and their struggle to find solid ground in the homes of Adam, their alcoholic father, and Eve, their negligent mother. The children ultimately run away and find a temporary life for themselves around the town of New Bedford, MA. What begins as a disturbing family drama becomes a rousing childhood adventure that, though tragic, is a deeply moving and hopeful testament to the poetry of adventure and the imagination of childhood.",/4oKvplrtVHMyuckaUWDOBpKMFwz.jpg,2.594,tt11685322,,,,,,
