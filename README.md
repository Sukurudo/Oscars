# Oscar Prediction Analysis

## Topic
Academy Awards(Oscars) is a big event for film industry as the award signify international recognition of excellence for actors, directors, writers, designers, and much more. The awards are given with a variety of different nominees from across different genres. To celebrate the world’s love of art and our love of data, we’ve leveraged the power of automated machine learning to put together our own prediction for which nominee is most likely to win Oscar for different categories.

## Reason/Objective
We wanted to do the project to celebrate the world’s love of art and our love of data.

## Data Source
- Data Source: 
  1. [Movie Data](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset "Movie Data")
  2. [Oscar Award Data](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/the-oscar-award "Oscar Award Data")
  
- Software: 
- 1. Tablaeu
- 2. Python, Pandas and SciKitLearn
- 3. Postgres and AWS

## Result
We are planning to build the machine learning model which will predict whether the particular movie will win the award in any category.

# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will connect it to AWS environment to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Currently we are using the RandomForestClassifier to check the accuracy of the data

## Dashboard
We are planning to use Tableau for the dashboard.
